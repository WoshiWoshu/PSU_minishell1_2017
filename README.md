First year mini project in C consisting of a simply version of the UNIX command line interpreter. It displays a prompt and then wait for the next command line. It implement one of the basic following UNIX commands : cd, setenv, unsetenv, env, exit, ls, cd, mkdir etc... Therefore it can not handle pipes, redirections or any other advanced features.
